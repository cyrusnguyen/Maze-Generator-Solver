# Maze-Generator-Solver
## ABOUT: 

This software was developed through the collaboration of the members in Group_97. This application is for the automatic generation of mazes with producible solutions.

The application is developed using Java as the primary programming language and Java Swing for GUI development. The database management system used is MariaDB. Testing is done using JUnit to ensure the functionality of the application.

The maze generator allows users to select the size and complexity of the maze, and generates a maze using algorithms such as recursive backtracking, Kruskal's algorithm. The solved maze is displayed on the GUI, highlighting the solution path.

The solver portion of the application supports various algorithms such as depth-first search. The application utilises MariaDB as a reliable database management system to store maze and solver data. This provides efficient data management and retrieval for all users of the application.

The application is tested rigorously using JUnit with automated tests to ensure that all functionality of the application works smoothly and correctly. This ensures a high level of quality and reliability in the application.
