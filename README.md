# Maze-Generator-Solver
## ABOUT: 

This software was developed through the collaboration of the members in Group_97. This application is for the automatic generation of mazes with producible solutions.

Java is used as the main programming language for the application, and Java Swing is used for GUI development. MariaDB is the database management system in use. JUnit testing is used to verify the application's functionality.

Users can customise the maze's size and complexity using the maze generator, which creates a maze using a recursive backtracking method. The GUI shows a solved maze with the solution path highlighted.

Algorithm depth-first search is supported by the application's solver. To store information on mazes and solvers, the application uses the dependable database management system MariaDB. All application users can effectively maintain and retrieve their data thanks to this.

To guarantee that the application's whole functionality operates without glitches and accurately, JUnit is used to conduct thorough automated tests on the application. This guarantees the application will be of the finest quality and reliability.
